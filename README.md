# World Weather Analysis
## Overview of the World Weather Analysis
### Purpose
In this project, we helped the company, PlanMyTravel. We cleaned, analyzed, and used linear regression on the weather parameters in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to improve PlanMyTravelâ€™s app for their customers. We first retrieved the weather data then created a travel destinations map based on the preferred minimum and maximum temperatures inputed by the customer. The travel destinations map supplied the customer with all of the available places to travel with an information box that included a hotel, the city, the country, a current weather description and the maximum temperature. After creating the travel destinations map, we assembled a travel itinerary map. The travel itinerary map included 4 cities in close proximity to each other that the customer could travel to as well. The travel itinerary map also had an information box on each city that contained a hotel, the city, the country, the current weather description and maximum temperature.
